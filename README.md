# Hey there, I'm Mannat! 

I'm a First-year computer science student at the University of Surrey, passionate about the intersection of **technology, intelligence analysis, and defence systems**.  
Most of my work focuses on building small, applied projects that lean heavily on the intersections of electrical, mechanical and computational models.

###  What You'll Find Here
This GitHub is where I document my learning and progress through projects that reflect what I’m genuinely curious about.
Expect to see:
- **Web-based simulations** (Jet engine models)
- **Cybersecurity & cryptography experiments**
- **AI-driven intelligence analysis tools**
- **Geopolitical and data visualisation prototypes**
- **Defence and aerospace concept simulations**
- **Algorithmic and systems projects** 

-They are really simple models, as for now, but I will be updating them as my skill level increases.

### My Current Interests
**Systems Engineering** -designing efficient, modular systems inspired by aerospace or frameworks  
**Cybersecurity & Intelligence Tech** -exploring tools for data collection, encryption, and risk assessment  
**Geopolitical Data Analytics** -using open-source intelligence (OSINT) web scraping and automation for situational awareness
**Machine Learning for Security** -applying AI models to detect or predict real-world patterns in markets and how the political situation influences them.

### Tools & Languages
- **Languages:** Python, Java, JavaScript, HTML/CSS   
- **Areas of Focus:** Cryptography, Simulations, Intelligence Systems, Embedded Logic, Robotics and Avionics

### Reach Me
- **Email** - mannatchauhan2008@gmail.com
- Always open to collaborating on projects that connect computer science with real-world systems, have political discussions or strategic applications
